# InstagramStoriesSchedule

This program allows you to effectively schedule your **Instagram Story **posts using Excel. It saves significant time for individuals and social media managers who manage multiple Instagram accounts. The program makes it possible to plan your content in an organized and systematic way, making social media management more efficient. 

Unlike all other programs, **all stickers **such as quizzes, surveys, question-answers, tests, etc. can be used 100% while sharing **Instagram Stories.** This program is useful for professionals who manage multiple Instagram accounts.

For example, imagine you have **5 Instagram accounts** and you need to plan an Instagram story for each of them. Also imagine that you have a different story strategy for each account. For example, for one account, you might use the question and answer tag frequently, while for others you might use tags like links and polls.

In this case, regular story sharing for multiple accounts would be quite time-consuming. While there are alternative solutions, these methods usually restrict the use of tags.

Doing this manually via Facebook Creator Studio would be time-consuming and complicated. Also, Facebook Creator Studio does not allow tag sharing.  You will have a very limited use. It would be quite tiring to share stories on many Instagram accounts at the same time in an organized way.


Instead, with this Excel-based program, you can manage and develop your content more easily. Thanks to the flexibility of Excel, you can see all your social media content at a glance and make quick edits as needed.

Another advantage of the program is that social media content is securely stored on your computer and easily managed. This way, all the content you produce is stored in an organized manner and can be quickly accessed when needed. You can also categorize your content by date, topic and other criteria, allowing for more strategic social media planning. In addition, it allows you to easily share stories that are repetitive, use similar tags, or even have a template.

In summary, this program significantly improves the way you plan, manage and optimize your social media content. It is a great convenience for users with multiple accounts and an indispensable tool for professional social media managers.

## How to use the program, what is the standard filing style?

The first step is to access the folder of the social media site that we will be working on. As you can see in the image below, the folders of the main social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter are located in this section.

In this step, since we plan to focus primarily on Instagram Stories, we log in directly to the Instagram folder. This folder contains all the tools and files to plan and manage Instagram-specific content.

Depending on needs and preferences, necessary revisions can be made to the code. With this flexibility, you can effectively manage and optimize your content on both platforms.

This process helps you organize your social media content more efficiently and develop a cohesive sharing strategy across both platforms.

After logging into the Instagram folder, the second step is to decide which type of post to make. Since we will share stories at this stage, there is only one option. This option is the Story folder.

At this stage, you can run the relevant code block by selecting which type of content you want to share. 

<div align="center">

</div>

At this stage, we log in to the Story folder. Within the Story folder, there are subfolders belonging to various Instagram accounts. Each folder in the image below represents a specific Instagram account. These folders contain Story content that is planned to be shared on the relevant accounts.

</div>

In each account folder, you can find and manage the content to be shared in Story specific to that account. Thanks to this structure, you can organize the content of each account separately and follow the sharing processes more regularly. As seen below, .mp4 format files are uploaded to the folder for planning purposes. All content found here can be shared.

As we approach the final stages, organizing the Excel Sheet is critical to developing an effective sharing strategy. Each Excel Sheet represents an owned Instagram account. This Excel Scheduling file is used to efficiently organize content descriptions, post dates, times, tag options, locations, colors and sizes, and any customizations that can be made.

The two images below show the Excel File prepared and edited for Instagram Story sharing. Here, using the Active/Passive options, it can be edited which tag is desired to be used in which story. In addition, the coordinate, size and color of the tag can also be set again in the excel file.
